# MUHAMMAD ZAID PORTFOLIO

Project 1 : User Centric Frontend Development -Code Institute

This is a portfolio website which represent me, as an aspiring software developers. It showcases my projects , brief about myself, coding skills and a contact segment which we could exchange contact details.


## UX
I decide to make a one- pager website to showcase my portfolio to potential employers. My intent is to be objective so I decide to have a projects showcase at the top as my first main content to be the first eye catcher display.

## Technologies

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4.FontAwesome

## Features

The site has smooth scrolling. Also in desktop mode, I have made a slight animation when the user hover on the project picture by playing around with the grayscale percentage of the image.

## Testing

The website has been tested with multiple mobile devices to ensure the content is still organize and able to display as required on multiple screen sizes.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
